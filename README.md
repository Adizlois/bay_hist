## Bayesian History Matching 

Implementation of an adapted version of the Bayesian History Matching algorithm described in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003968"> Adrianakis et al 2015 </a>


The "run_waves.py" script contains an example of the application of the method to an ABM model (which is not included in this repository). This can be easily adapted for other models.


The file "config.py" contains general variables such as paths or age groups. This is updated directly from the "run_waves" script.


Bayesian_hm contains all the core functions.
